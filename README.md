# PythonFirstProjects
My first Python projects and games, all in one repository

It includes :
- A few sorting algorithms
- A little program that turns images into Ascii art
- A few games like Othello, Chess, Connect 4, Tetris...
- 2 tools to draw shapes and pixel art, exporting the results as tkinter functions
- A little plateforming game with a level editor and a bunch of tiles to play with
- Other random pieces of code
